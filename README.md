Please remember your target audience when adding content to the website. This site is made for people who have never seen code before. Handholding the user and expecting very little prior technical knowledge is the name of the game.

The goal of the website is to get the Swift playground on the user's mac and the user reading it. currently the biggest gotcha to that is the user needs to download Xcode so a section on Xcode is currently what we need to work on

## Road Map
